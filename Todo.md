# What's Working?

- Flashcards are arranged in the correct order.
- Buttons for I know this and don't know works.
- Cards are getting removed and pushed properly

# What's Left to do?

- Change the deck property of the flashcard before removing and pushing.
- Display a chip stating which deck does the current question belong to.
- Create a page with form for creating multiple flashcards at once.
- Push the created cards from form to the unseen array.
- Add some UI which says "Do you wanna start practicing your flashcards?" and only after user clicks yes, display the flashcards.
- Create a portal which displays a modal stating that the revision of all cards is complete. Do you wish to continue.
- Once all the questions have been exhausted from the viewing deck, Re-create the viewing deck.
